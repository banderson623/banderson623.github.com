I recently picked up a copy of [Art of Computer Programming, Fundamental Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Fundamental-Algorithms/dp/0201896834) by [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/). This sentence, from the Introduction, captured my attention:

> The process of preparing a program for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music. This books is the first volume of a multi-volume set of books that has been designed to train the reader in various skills that go into a programmer's craft...

Knuth succinctly identifies the two qualities of software writing that I really enjoy. The **creative aesthetic** experience (similar to the arts) that should be diligently practiced to develop as a **craft**.
