Someone asked [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/), who I've [quoted before](/articles/2013/03/15/art-of-programming-knuth/), why he uses the phrase: "A computer scientists perspective" and "How [he] distinguishes that from other points of view?"

Knuth, while reflecting on the rapid adoption of Computer Science programs across many universities in the 1960's, said:

> I'm convinced that computer science grew so fast and is vital today because there are people all over the world who have a peculiar way of thinking, a certain way of structuring knowledge in their heads, a mentality that we now associate with a discipline of its own. This mentality isn't sharply focused, in the space of all possible ways of thinking; but it's different enough from other ways &mdash; that the people who had it in the old days were scattered among many different departments, more or less orphans in their universities.

A Historical Accident:

> ... The fact that this mode of thinking never had a name until quite recently is just a historical accident...

> I didn't choose to be a computer scientist because my main mission in life was to advance computation. I chose computer science simply because I was good at it. For some reason, my peculiar way of thinking correlated well with computers.

Knuth continues on about abstraction and nonuniform structures

> One of the main characteristics of a computer science mentality is the ability to jump very quickly between levels of abstraction, between a low level and a high level, almost unconsciously

> Another characteristic ... [is the ability] to deal with non uniform structures &mdash; case 1, case 2, case 3 &mdash; while a mathematician will tend to want one unifying axiom that governs an entire system.

I appreciate the way Knuth thinks about subjects. His writing is simple to read, yet rich in content and ideas. I believe it is this ability &mdash; to explain profound ideas in simple and  tangible ways &mdash; that makes him an ideal _Computer Scientist._

This content is from a lecture he gave at MIT in 1999. He was introducing a lecture series titled: _[Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/mit-lectures.html)_ where he covers the topic of faith. You can read the [notes from his first lecture](http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/pdf/1575863278.pdf). The complete lecture series was [published as a book](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/things.html) available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Computer-Scientist-Language-Information/dp/157586326X).
