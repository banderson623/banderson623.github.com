Hello, I am **Brian Anderson**, and I would like to be your `Write In` choice for the upcoming Gilbert District School Board Election on Tuesday.

_I am not running to reform the district. I am running to support the strengths of what has been done before us and shepherd it into the next decade._

## I am running with the following goals:

* I'd like to share **clear, open, communication** of the school board's decisions and upcoming district changes that impact our families.

* I love Gilbert Schools, our teachers, administrators and families – **I want to preserve our values and intimacy as we continue to grow over the next 10 years.**

* **Integration of learning and technology**. We need a holistic plan for using technology to aid in our children's learning, and I would like help build it. Technology does not solve everything, nor does it destroy everything. Computers are everywhere, lets make sure we have a plan to help our families, teachers and students make the most of these tools.

* I want to **encourage our four district buildings to work with one another, the neighborhoods and the city.**  We have a rich opportunity for our students to learn through serving those around them, lets do it!

* **Find creative ways to fund** fine arts, extra curricular activities and clubs. We have a great, engaged parent-base – I want to find ways to educate our kids beyond the traditional subjects, even if the state is unwilling to pay.

* **I'd love to start a handful of after school programs**. Wouldn't it be great to have some of the high tech parents and Iowa State students run a programming workshop?

## I just want to write you in!

I'd appreciate your vote on Tuesday, September 8. Put in on your calendar and remember me: "Brian Anderson" (a pretty average person who enjoys our schools… no need to write anything more than my name though).
