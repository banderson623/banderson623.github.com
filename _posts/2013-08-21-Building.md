<blockquote class="biggest"><p>&ldquo;Startup&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

I find myself more and more annoyed with this word. It's the over glorification of starting something. It's the pass that the entire scene is given. 
* Quality products? 
* Delighted customers?
* Sustaining revenue?  

*&ldquo;nah, who cares man, Start something!&rdquo;*

I am certain there are people who **love starting things.** Pioneers who don't mind the risks nor being alone, they just want to get out there and do it. And then there is another set of people who enjoy **creating efficient businesses**. My guess is that a healthy capitalistic society needs both of those types of women and men engaged and doing what they love.[^1]

But, I am not them.

<!-- # I Want to build products, not businesses -->

For me, a business only exists so that I can sell a **product** (if it is worth selling). And at some point you need to create a business (if none existed before). At that point the business is starting up. 

I am hesitant to call young, small, companies &ldquo;startups&rdquo;. There is nothing magical or special about them. They are just young and probably fighting to earn back resources it took to develop the product.

Go build something! Dream big. Delight people. Wow them with your creativity and execution. [Build a great product!](/articles/2013/08/15/Does-The-Product-Matter/)

Did I miss something? Think I am crazy? I'd enjoy hearing from you [@banderson623](https://twitter.com/banderson623).

[^1]: I am not bothered by young companies or fresh ideas â€“ both are great! **Rather it is the &ldquo;startup scene&rdquo; that annoys me.**
