"You going to eat that?" Is  my first memory of Ben. We had just moved to the middle of Nowhere, Iowa, and had met Isaac Law. His younger brother Ben, came with him for a Sunday afternoon meal at our house. Ben was a near-competitive eater. He polished of three brats and half a pizza that lazy afternoon on our back deck. Post high school metabolism - it's the Formula One of gastrointestinal efficiency.

Months earlier my wife and I met a young high school girl who was a famous babysitter, well at least famous in the mighty city of Ames. Her father, Bob, had offered me  a few hours of Linux administration side work.

My wife and I had moved our budding family of three to fly-over cornville. We came as a part of a team of three other families to be a part of a new church group. (When that was too weird, we'd just tell people we wanted an idyllic location to raise a family).

Bob, who at this time was offering me 20 or more hours of work a week, was old and stubborn. We argued about life and church for many late hours while waiting for database migrations to complete. Having been to bible college and part of a failed church - I knew it all - I wanted Bob to know it. I was that 20-something smug turd. He patiently challenged my views of life, parenting and my own a attitude. A year later I was working with him full time and I was the stubborn moron - insisting Bob's views of family and life were a crusty relic of mid-country ways.

Somewhere along this time, we met his daughter at church-event. Occasionally she came in the office to do homework. My wife and I  had heard stories about her being a child-charmer. There wasn't a kid around who didn't know or love Amanda. Somehow she became a regular babysitter for us. Joining us on a multi family trip to be our native opare.

Amanda possessed a quality that many of us want to have, or even  trick ourselves into thinking we have - she was happiest when serving others. It was truly amazing to see her babysit, clean, talk with others. She rarely complained, was quick to laugh,  and serious about getting tasks done.

Somewhere during this time Ben Law moved from some farm somewhere to Ames. He was eager to be a part of a quirky automotive restoration company. (It's too long to explain here, but I own half of that company). Ben was also intrigued by the way we were thinking about church. He was a young man full of passion for doing the right thing; for helping others; and growing up into a mature and thoughtful adult. (He was also good at eating, as I mentioned before).

It didn't take long for Ben to notice Amanda. Some of which was fueled by Ben's older sisters friendship with Amanda. Or that they were both working at the automotive shop together.

They grew to know and love each other through babysitting, moving families in the church, wrangling Amanda's four younger rambunctious brothers and always being the first to sign up or show up to help. Ben waited patiently to gain Bobs approval (of course I thought bob was crazy to delay their relationship).

In the summer of 2011 Ben and Amanda married. It was the culmination of endless patience on their part - and serious love and attention on Bob and his wife. Everyone in the church was excited for them - two people who love Jesus and were filled with excitement for the life before them. We all joked that Amanda's love for kids, and Ben's monastic patience would produce a honeymoon baby. They continued to serve and help people in the city. Babysitting, fixing vehicles, remodeling homes, lumberjacking, watching more kids, and tirelessly working at the boutique automotive shop. Amanda finished up her last year at of college at Iowa State and they were preparing for their future.

Then Amanda started to get sick. She got tired more easily. She wasn't able to help out as often. She frequently had a pain or a cold that prevented her from leaving the house some days. The doctors offered little help - suggesting Amanda was depressed. Their life was turned upside down in January of this year when Amanda, being too weak to get ready for the day, went to the ER.

Amanda was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

She went through three rounds of chemo.

She became weak, tired and her hair began to look like mine.

The serious love and hopeful parenting that Bob and his wife embodied was on display for everyone to see. The result was a young woman, journeying through the hell of chemo therapy with hope and endurance. Ben's love for Amanda and tireless desire to make their life together amount to something. They repurposed their lives, adjusted their life to
