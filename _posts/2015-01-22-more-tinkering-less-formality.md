After writing [Exploratory Science and Technology Project](http://bitbyteyum.com/articles/2015/01/19/exploratory-science-and-technology-project) I sent it around to a few friends. Most people glanced at it and said it was a cool project. But I did receive excellent feedback from my friend Ed Semplinski.[^coach]

> My first impression is _too much initial structure_.  What got me interested in learning more was taking stuff apart to understand it better and then put it back together, improve on it or repurpose it.  **Curiosity** or **necessity** drove the next step, not a lesson plan.

He continued to write "the project should help establish a few things and allow you to evaluate: their level of interest, competence, weaknesses[^weakness], how they learn and view the world.

Ed's writing was excellent feedback.

## Is this too formalized?

Looking at the [Spudnik Project](https://github.com/banderson623/ProjectSpudnik), it is too formalized. I followed the classroom model that pushes students down a defined path, to guide them through a series of learning objectives. I don't think there is anything wrong with this model for mass education – but why did I force that paradigm onto a very different environment? 

Two young minds,  **tinkering** with items in their living room.

I am going to fork the project, and build it slowly, based on what they are curious about.

## Let them tinker

We will start simple. Asking the question of **what** is a potato canon? **How** does it work? Hopefully this will advance the conversation along and we can build one. **But possibly not**. This is a risk I am taking.

## They might not be interested…

…they might not be fascinated or curious with this problem. So we’ll journey down another path, and the project will change.

<p class="callout">This is terrifying, because the question then becomes, <em>how do I spark this curiosity?</em></p>

How do I find out their interests? What if I don't have the skill and knowledge to help them discover the answers to their questions?

This is the journey I am on.  I'll continue to update this site as we explore.  Today is our first time meeting. I will explain the general idea of our times together: 

* Explore how things work. 
* Try to build something new. 
* To tinker.

The last sentence in Ed's email read:

> I think you will be most successful letting THEM drive the curriculum and see where you end up… maybe build an autonomous IH Scout?

## Other resources

Ed also sent along a few links:

* The [Dangerous Book for Boys](http://www.garrettwade.com/the-dangerous-books-for-boys-series/p/25L04.01/)
* Gever Tulley's TED talk: [5 dangerous things you should let your kids do](
http://on.ted.com/b0hgZ).

[^coach]: I've written about [Ed before](http://bitbyteyum.com/articles/2013/06/04/Coaching/), he has been a huge motivating and positive influence in my life.

[^weakness]: "tool usage, critical thinking, manual dexterity, >mental dexterity, patience"
