Wow, I am speachless, I just checked the [Story County Election](http://www.storycountyiowa.gov/index.aspx?NID=853) site and I see they've posted the final results.

I won a seat. Two hundred and fifty two people wrote my name in. _That is a little over 21% of the votes._

Amazing. I am honored and indebted to the 252 people who wrote my name in. I will strive for [my goals](/projects/gilbert-school-board#i-am-running-with-the-following-goals) and to uphold [the values of our district that I appreciate so much](/articles/2015/09/07/question-values).

A little over 7 days ago, [last Thursday night](/projects/gilbert-school-board), I declared myself as a write-in option. What a whirlwind it has been since then. Thank you all! Later tonight I'll  post the journey of what happened from last Thursday evening until now.

_p.s. Starting my attempt at clear and transparent communication: The first School Board meeting, I am a part of, will be held on **Monday the 14th, 6pm in the District Conference Room** (Intermediate School). As far as I know the public is welcome to all school board meetings._
