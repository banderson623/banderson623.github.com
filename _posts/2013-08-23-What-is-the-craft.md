This morning I read [The Imperfect Craft](http://bitsplitting.org/2013/08/20/the-imperfect-craft/) from [Daniel Jalkut](http://bitsplitting.org/). It is a great article where he questions the craft of writing software. It really is a thoughtful piece, as to be expected from Jalkut[^1] 

> "For much of my career I viewed software development as a craft: a constructive endeavor with fixed standards of excellence. I thought that over a lifetime, I could assiduously refine my skills, inching toward some level of subjective mastery until eventually myself and others would agree that I had become “a real expert.”

> Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way with software. "

He writes that in order to stay useful, current and relevant developers need to continue to learn and grow. 

> "To remain relevant, I have to reject my previous assumption that I would spend a lifetime refining my craft. … But by diligently throwing out the old rules and embracing the new ones, I hope to come close."

You really should go read this article, It is a great piece. But, I wish that Jalkut wrote another paragraph or two *because I think he misidentified the craft.*

# So, What is the Craft?

Daniel defines the craft as "tools", "techniques", "rules" that may include references to topics such as "Memory management". "Multitasking", "Concurrent programming".

This is not how I define craft. **The craft is the deconstruction of the problem married with knowledge of the tools to build a good solution.** As the tools change, as the problems shift, our craft remains to understand this and build a maintainable solution. [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/) writes the mentality is ["a peculiar way of thinking, a certain way of structuring knowledge in their heads, a mentality."](/articles/2013/05/29/knuth-on-thinking/). 

So while I agree with Daniel Jalkut, we need to hold loosely to the current tools and techniques &mdash; the underlying craft is the ability to understand problems and use tools to build stuff.

Don't hold too tightly to the current techniques. Continue to learn. As [Ebert wrote](/articles/2013/04/04/remembering-ebert/) "all clear-minded people should remain two things throughout their lifetimes: Curious and teachable." or as [Steve Jobs quoted](/articles/2013/05/24/motivation/#fn:3) in his Stanford commencement address "Stay Hungry!"

[^1]: I've listened to all of his [Bitsplitting Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bitsplitting/id620090910?mt=2&partnerId=30&siteID=I9*2vU2JkMU) where he interviews  popular developers. I enjoyed how he exposed the human side of each developer and asked them about their background, specifically what got them into writing software.
