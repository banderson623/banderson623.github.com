<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Maybe you don't want to read all this...  you can just <a href="https://tinyletter.com/brian-in-gilbert">sign up for the newsletter</a>.</em></p>

I am starting a newsletter to make progress toward my [first goal](/projects/gilbert-school-board#i-am-running-with-the-following-goals):

> I'd like to share **clear, open, communication** of the school board's decisions and upcoming district changes that impact our families.

My goal is to keep the community informed and engaged with the district's happenings. I realize this isn't for everyone, and there are [many](http://gilbert.k12.ia.us/) [other](http://gilbert.k12.ia.us/district/board) [ways](http://gilbert.k12.ia.us/district/board/agenda) to stay aware of what is going on. This is just a convenient and timely way to have the information pushed to your inbox.

So, if this sounds useful, please signup for this newsletter. It will come out once or twice a month and will include:

* The date, time and location of the upcoming board meeting (so you can attend),
* Upcoming district board meeting topics,
* Previous board meeting decisions, and
* A link to ask a question _(as anonymous if you'd like)_

## Oh, this is great, I am in!

Excellent, sign up below.
