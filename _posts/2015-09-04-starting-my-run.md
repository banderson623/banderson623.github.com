On Friday morning [I started my write-in campaign](/projects/gilbert-school-board/) for school board. By 10am I had a handful of texts and dozens of emails from families pledging their support. It was an overwhelming response.

A friendly neighbor made some killer yard signs!

Sarina Rhinehart from the [Ames Tribune](http://amestrib.com) called me yesterday for a phone interview. I was nervous, being on the record with a reporter is very different than talking with neighbors. After 30 minutes, I was able talk my way through [why I am running](/projects/gilbert-school-board/). I felt like I was able explain my position while still honoring the others running in this race.

> With only days left until Tuesday’s school board election, Gilbert resident Brian Anderson has announced he is running for the Gilbert school board as a write-in candidate.

> Anderson made the decision to run after hearing the responses from the new candidates at Wednesday’s candidate forum. Anderson said he felt the candidates lacked experience working with district teachers and administration, and thought they were pushing for big agendas.

>"I don’t want to see huge reform," Anderson said. "My position is I’m really happy with most of the things we are doing"

I would encourage you to read [the Ames Tribune article](http://amestrib.com/news/write-candidate-seeks-seat-gilbert-school-board) for a better understanding of why I am running.
