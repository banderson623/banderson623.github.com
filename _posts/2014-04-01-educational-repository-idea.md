Our local school has just received the [Teacher Leadership and Compensation](https://www.educateiowa.gov/teacher-leadership-and-compensation-system)(TLC) grant. The state of Iowa is offering school's $1.5M, over three years, in to _"reward effective teachers with leadership opportunities and higher pay, attract promising new teachers with competitive starting salaries and more support, and foster greater collaboration for all teachers to learn from each other."[^1]_ The grant allows for each district to tailor the implementation according to their schools[^2].

The [Gilbert School District](http://gilbert.k12.ia.us/) was awarded the grant starting in the Fall of 2014.

At Gilbert, they have opened a few new positions that will be filled by _"effective teachers"_, some of will be pulled out of the classroom to serve the other teachers[^3]. I was invited, with one other parent, to sit in on the interviews and listen to the candidates.  We have been a part of this district for three years, and I have no doubt all of the candidates are qualified and and would excel in the positions – which requires a passion for teaching and a deep care for the students and their families.

One of the positions available is the "Teacher Leadership and Compensation Coordinator", their primary task is to assist the district – teachers, students and parents – to make the most of this three year grant. This is especially important as our district is in the first batch of schools who have received this grant. Their job description includes:

# "Repository of Exemplar lessons"

As a software developer, the word "repository" has a specific meaning. This is where source code is stored and normally shared by all members on the team.

> The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

> These three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful. Gregg Pollack of Code School (which just launched a class called TryGit) explains that before GitHub, if you wanted to contribute to an open source project you had to manually download the project’s source code, make your changes locally, create a list of changes called a “patch” and then e-mail the patch to the project’s maintainer. The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, and decide whether to merge the changes.

> This is where the network effect starts to play a role in GitHub, Pollack explains. When you submit a pull request, the project’s maintainer can see your profile, which includes all of your contributions on GitHub. If your patch is accepted, you get credit on the original site, and it shows up in your profile. It’s like a resume that helps the maintainer determine your reputation. The more people and projects on GitHub, the better idea picture a project maintainer can get of potential contributors. Patches can also be publicly discussed.

[^1]: This is a bit of a run-on sentence isn't it?
[^2]: Seems sensible, use the state's large resources applied to local needs in ways shaped by local understanding.
[^3]: This will include many responsibilities: helping build lessons, adopt technology, demonstrate teaching concepts in the classroom, adopting standardized test data to be useful, ... and many other tasks.
