## Craft work is skilled work

* Craft work is skilled work: involve the application of a technique. 
* the German Kraft, simply means power or ability. 
* Craft involves technique, yes, but not necessarily mechanical technology.  
* Craft implies the application of human intelligence 
* The craftsman has tools at command

## Useful objects

* The concept of craft is historically associated with the production of useful objects
* (the artist’s work is typically without utilitarian function) 


Kant said "Works of art are “intrinsically final" they appeal purely at the level of the imagination and aren’t good for any practical utility, except the cultivation of the human spirit.""
