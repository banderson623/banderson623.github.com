I've been helping a friend learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)[^1]. And like most programming conversations it drifts from syntax, problem specific, conversation into architectural and philosophical depth. Our recent conversations remind me of the countless hours my coworkers have spent with me, teaching me how to craft software. We walked through the design, syntax and style &mdash; I learned a lot apprenticing under great tutors.

## My Beginnings

In 2002 I made a dramatic career move and started working at a young, small, company. I had just left my teenage dream job of interning as a middle school pastor-guy at my church.[^2] I bailed on bible college and was ready for a big career change! Like many Silicon Valley kids in the 90's, I grew up geeked out and writing [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and doodling in pirated copies of Photoshop[^3]. I slowly started writing their intranet applications in php. It was some bad code, but I had the good fortune of being around a handful of great C/C++ developers.

Prior to this, I had taken a couple of programming classes in High School and I knew I could hack my way around making something pretty appear on the screen. But I also knew that there was more to programming than just getting the right result to eventually show up. So I started researching and reading. I picked up a copy of [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) written by by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. That was the beginning of my professional software developer journey. Their forward includes the following:

> Programming is a **craft**. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator.
and a couple chapters later they write
> Every craftsman starts his or her journey with a basic set of good-quality tools. A woodworker might need rules, gauges, a couple of saws, some good planes, fine chisels, drills and braces, mallets, and clamps... the tools become conduits from the craftsman's brain to the finished product—they have become extensions of his or her hands. ...Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive you can be. 

They framed programming as a journey from journeyman to a master craftsman. The progression from apprentice to mastery. The tools were knowledge of the language, ability to perceive systems and dissect them and knowledge of text editors and IDEs. In addition to this I had coworkers and managers who enabled this progression and helped me in many ways. I was extremely fortunate to be surrounded by these people. 

## Okay, So Back to My Friend

He is a stellar front end usability and HTML/CSS guy[^4]. It is a blast working with him to learn a new language and framework. He has a lot of PHP experience so its really a matter of learning the syntax and style of Ruby. 

One afternoon this week he casually sends me iMessage.

> ...How do you know you wanted to be at CURRENT_EMPLOYER over PREVIOUS_EMPLOYER 
> * What was the piece that attracted you to them? 
> * Was it the product? was it the people? 
> * was it the tech? 
> * was it the problems to solve? all of the above? 
> how do you know in 2 years that love or excitement won’t fade away?

I've spent the last 11 years of my professional life writing software. With the exception of two years, I worked  to place myself in contexts were I'd be challenged, [pushed](articles/2013/06/04/Coaching/) and would be on the steep side of the learning curve. Of course, I didn't always succeed or have a great attitude initially. *Learning from failures is powerful, though I don't know I'd have the endurance to only learn this way*. Overall I did learn a lot. I got to ship products written in PHP, Ruby, Java, Groovy, C and C++. Every step I tried to find people who could mentor me in developing high quality software.

## Two Sacrifices

The software development market is great and relative to many other jobs the pay and flexibility is great. It is mentally stimulating, portable, location independent and accessible to anyone who can use a computer[^5]. It fits well with the way service-oriented direction our country's economy is going. Our always-on always-connected lives require more software than ever before.

But along the way I sacrificed:

1. Increased pay
2. Building a product I was passionate about.

As a young developer, I was more interested in the learning, people, methods, tools and programming languages than anything else. That focus has served me well for the first ten years. Through another series of events[^6] I found myself intensely thinking through my impending job change. What did I want?

<div class="super-highlight"> 
<p>I knew I wanted to build a product that I was passionate about!</p>
</div>

Of course I didn't want to ditch the other qualities. I wanted to work with people who loved what they did. People who were competent to write amazing software. People who enjoyed each other. I also knew I didn't want to work at a large company or on a large team because I doubt that this culture exists in big companies. I am sure there are individuals who are incredible in big organizations, but after some size there is enough organizational-cruft works to suck the humanity out of people.

I also wanted a place where I could be proud of my work. A place where I could contribute and have significance. I also wanted to continue working at a place that would challenge me with difficult and exciting problems.

[^5]: I mean this in the physical accessibility sense, clearly not everyone is able to successfully write software. It is a skill that takes time to develop and requires a certain mental-anility.
